# Task 3: Linear Regression on House Prices Dataset

This project applies simple and multiple linear regression techniques using Python and scikit-learn to predict house prices based on numerical features. It is part of my AI & ML internship focused on building predictive modeling skills.

## 📂 Dataset Used
- **Name**: House Prices – Advanced Regression Techniques
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
- **File**: `train.csv`
- **Target Variable**: `SalePrice`

---

## 📌 Objective
To predict house sale prices using linear regression models based on relevant features like `GrLivArea`, `OverallQual`, and `GarageCars`.

---

## 🔍 Key Steps
1. Import & explore dataset
2. Handle missing values (initial check only)
3. Build a **Simple Linear Regression** model (1 feature)
4. Build a **Multiple Linear Regression** model (3 features)
5. Evaluate models using:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R² Score
6. Visualize the simple regression line

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
